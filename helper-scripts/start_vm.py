# This script starts qemu with the CPU layout specified by the cores
# array below. Each element in the array represents a core. To enable
# hyper-threading (i.e. two logical cores per core), each element in
# the array should be an array of length two. The values stored inside
# the array define to which host cores the guest cores should be
# affinitized. All arguments of this script are passed to qemu
# directly. Porting an existing qemu command line setup to make use of
# this script requires removing the -smp parameters and -qmp
# parameters if those were used. These are built by the script based
# on the cores array.

# After successfully starting qemu, this script will connect through
# QMP and affinitize all cores within the VM to match cores on the
# host.
